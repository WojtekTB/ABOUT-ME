# Victor's User Page
This is a page where I ~~ramble~~ talk about what kind of programmer I am for `CSE 110` class.

> What is your favorite programming language?

It is definately JavaScript. I find that, even though a lot of things about it make it infuriating to use, the sheer amount of stuff already made for it makes it easy and fast to make virtually anything you want. If I were to choose a language to seriously work in though it would definately be C#.

I mostly just love coding in C# because it makes it so easy to make things feel intuitive for whoever will use your code next. For example you can make properties for classes that are actually functions like so:
```C#
class SomeClass {
    int myProperty {
        get {
            return someFunction();
        }
        set {
            someInsideValue = value;
        }
    }
}
```

Ah I miss working with it so much! Too bad it is not really used on the web.

> What is your favorite project?

I really liked the platformer I made in highschool. You can see it [here](https://silos.onrender.com/). I later made it multiplayer too. It was a fun experience trying to code as much of it myself as I could.

I also don't know where to put this part so here is a relative link to a [different file with a cat picture](./CAT.md).

- Cronometer
- Hevy app
- I can't think of another one right now but the list with only two points seemed weird.
